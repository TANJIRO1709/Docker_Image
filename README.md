WE CAN CREATE DOCKER IMAGES USING MANY LANGAUAGES IN THIS CASE NODE JS HAS BEEN USED. A NODE IMAGE WAS UPLOADED ON THE DOCKER LOCALLY AND THEN PUSHED INTO THE DOCKER HUB. NOW IT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO BE PULLED EASILY


## Installation

Pull image with docker

```bash
  docker pull tanjiro1709/hey-nodejs
```
